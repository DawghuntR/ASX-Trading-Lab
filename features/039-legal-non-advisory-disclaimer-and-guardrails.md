# 039 - Legal/Non-Advisory Disclaimer & Guardrails

Add explicit project guardrails to keep the system positioned as decision support and research tooling, not automated trading advice.

## Description

- Add UI and documentation disclaimers:
  - educational/research purpose
  - not financial advice
  - data may be delayed/incorrect
- Add wording guidelines for signals (avoid certainty).

## Impact

- Reduces compliance/ethical risk and sets user expectations.

## Success Criteria

- UI displays a disclaimer.
- Documentation includes disclaimers and usage boundaries.
